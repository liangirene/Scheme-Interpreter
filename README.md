# Scheme-Interpreter
In this project, I developed an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. This allowed me to explore the intricacies and challenges involved in programming language design.

Throughout the development process, I  considered the characteristics of the Scheme subset and made design choices that ensured compatibility within its defined boundaries. While my interpreter may exhibit slight variations in behavior compared to other implementations, I maintained fidelity within the specified subset.

In addition to building the interpreter, I also wrote small programs in Scheme. This exercise revealed the simplicity and power of the language, while highlighting the transferability of programming concepts across different languages, including Python.

By undertaking this project, I deepened my understanding of programming language concepts and honed my skills in interpreter development. It provided me with practical experience in working with Scheme, enhancing my ability to work with diverse programming languages. This project served as a valuable exploration of language interpretation and functional programming principles.
